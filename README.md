# Magellan META Repository

This repository serves for providing configuration data to the Magellan client and possibly other programs and services. Until now, metadata was hosted at https://magellan-client.sourceforge.io/locations.properties and the client accessed this file to check the latest version numbers and link to the current homepage in the About dialog. This is located here, and not, for example, in a release in the magellan2 repository, for safety reasons. Future Magellan versions shall link to this repository. it contains

  - locations.properties: A property file serving the Magellan classes MagellanUrl and, by extension, VersionInfo with the necessary information
